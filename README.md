###Description: 
    This is a React project using a fetch call to the Open Weather Map API. Type a City and a Country in to the input fields and the page will display the current temperature (F), humidity, and current weather condition. 

###Why: 
    This was part of a school project through Austin Coding Academy. Our goal was to make a fully functioning site that utilized an API fetch call. I chose to do a weather app because I love traveling and being outdoors. 

###Goals: 
    I would like to continue to add more features to this site, here are some of my ideas:
    - ability to change between Fahrenheit and Celcius
    - add icons/animations to match weather conditions 
    - make it more user friendly for 'city, state' format instead of 'city, country'
    - show location on a map

###Deployment: 
    Site is hosted on gh-pages: (https://shelbyinloes.github.io/WeatherAPI/)

###Issues/Bugs:
    This is still a styling work in progress. 
    I may only be using front-end technologies to this application, it will be hard work to implement a backend from how this is set up currently.
